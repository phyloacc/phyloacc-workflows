# This is a csv file that at minimum must have a column called "accession" for each sample in the MAF
# The accession should be an NCBI Assembly accession number and will be used to look up the GC content of the genome
# for modFreqs
# Alternatively, if a column called "gc" is present, the GC content will be taken from that column
